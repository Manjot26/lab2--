 Some parts of the code were generated with AI assistance (ChatGPT) and modified to meet the project requirements.
 YouTube tutorials and GitHub repositories served as sources of inspiration for the UI's structure and logic, which contributed to the overall design and functionality. Future Enhancements
 Exponentiation, the square root, and other advanced functions can be used. Enhance UI with more appealing themes and animations. Add history tracking for calculations.
